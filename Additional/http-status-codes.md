# HTTP response status codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

- Informational responses (100‚Äì199)
- Successful responses (200‚Äì299)
- Redirects (300‚Äì399)
- Client errors (400‚Äì499)
- and Server errors (500‚Äì599)

The below list is a summary of the most common HTTP status codes:

- 200 OK
  - The request succeeded. The result and meaning  of "success" depends on the HTTP method:
    - GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.
    - PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
- 201 Created
  - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
- 204 No Content
  - The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.
- 400 Bad Request
  - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error.
- 401 Unauthorized
  - Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
- 403 Forbidden
  - The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource.
- 404 Not Found
  - The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.
- 405 Method Not Allowed
  - A request method is not supported for the requested resource.
- 500 Internal Server Error
  - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
- 501 Not Implemented
  - The server either does not recognize the request method or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.
- 503 Service Unavailable
  - The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.
