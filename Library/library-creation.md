# Library Creation Step By Step

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a library in Android Studio.

## Step 1: Create a New Project

- Create a new project or refactor an existing one into a library module.
- Use Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA to create a module: `File -> New -> New Module -> Android Library` (for Android) or a plain Java/Kotlin library module.
- Name the module and set the package name.

## Step 2: Define the Library

- Define the library's API.
- Define the library's public classes and methods.
- Define the library's public constants and interfaces.

## Step 3: Implement the Library

- Implement the library's classes and methods.
- Implement the library's constants and interfaces.

## Step 4: Test the Library

- Write unit tests for the library.
- Test the library's classes and methods.
- Test the library's constants and interfaces.

## Step 5: Document the Library

- Write Javadoc comments for the library's classes and methods.
- Write Javadoc comments for the library's constants and interfaces.
- Generate Javadoc documentation for the library.

## Step 6: Organize Your Files

- Place reusable code inside the library module.
- Include clear `README.md` documentation at the root of your repository.
- Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to specify the library's usage terms.
- Include a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- Ensure your library code is well-documented and tested.
- Add sample code or a demo app to showcase the library's features.

## Step 7: [Android Library Jitpack Deployment](Library/library-jitpack-deployment.md)

- Prepare for Distribution
- Publish with JitPack
- Add Usage Instructions to the `README.md`
- Test the Published Library
- Maintain and Update
- Troubleshooting
